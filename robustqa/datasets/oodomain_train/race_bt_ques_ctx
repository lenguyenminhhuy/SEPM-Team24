Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but bottomed out at about 7.5 miles below the surface. The Mohole project, an American plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a 25-mile hole at the border between the hard rocks of the crust and the mild coat. Unfortunately, the project involved the government supporting. It becomes stronger and harder to drill deeply in the earth, because the rocks become softer and softer. Difficult but easily broken on the surface, the rocks become plastic in depth and the pressure caused by the weight of the recovery crust - about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes an extra drilling impossible. What we know little of the interior of the earth (like the fact that there is a crust, a coat and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as earthquake analysis. So, maybe it's time for a further in-depth method to explore the land inside. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget the drill holes. Instead, we should open a crack. Stevenson suggests digging a crack of about half a mile long, a wide courtyard and a half-mile of depth (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Then he would see a few hundred thousand tons of melted iron in the crack, with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, move down to about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the deeper and deeper crack. The iron mass would fall for about a week and 2,000 miles on the outer edge of the core of the Earth, the robot sends data to the surface. Stevenson compares its idea for spatial exploration. \"We're going somewhere we were not before,\" he says. \"In all possibilities, there will be surprises.\" This idea can probably be put in the labeled drawer not to happen.

As school budgets become smaller, a growing number of schools in the United States sell, advertising on lockers and buses and gyms or cafeterias. It's an easy way for schools to make money. And advertisements can provide relief for exhausted parents by making cash donations to support schools. Although parents can always turn off the TVs or computers, they can not continue to advertise schools. This is not the first time the question arrived. For example, an information program for adolescents has been criticized for announcements including 12-minute classroom emissions. Parent groups have successfully fought a plan by a company called radio bus to put music and ads in school buses. But now, things are different. Last month, Los Angeles approved a plan to enable businesses to advertise in district schools. Civil servants say the plan could provide up to $ 18 million for schools. St. Francis, Minn, schools have recently agreed to cover 10% to 15% of their lockers with ads. Time says. Edward Saxton, a school teacher, said, \"So far, parents accept it as a way to bring money.

How do such clutter problems arise and could they be reduced? Some researchers think we can find answers through a more familiar system in which jams appear - road traffic flow. Martin Treiber, from the Technical University of Dresden, Germany, has already developed traffic flow models. One of the first traffic flow modeling attempts was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham from Manchester University. They considered traffic as a kind of liquid flowing in a pipe and examined how the flow changes when the fluid becomes denser. At first, the flow increases as the density increases because you simply get more things during the same period. But if the density becomes too high, there is a risk of jam and the flow falls sharply. The marathon model of a Treiber marathon uses the same principle that the flow increases first and then decreases while the density of the riders increases, thanks to a sudden switch of a free flow to the congested stream. It assumes that there is a different preferred speed range for different runners, that everyone keeps throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow of the runners, knowing the \"load capacity\" at each point of the route. This allows Treiber to determine how blocking could depend on race conditions - for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons begin to leave all the riders parties at once (which means that those at the back must wait for those who are at the front moved). Others assign runners to various groups based on capacity and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber applied the Rennsteig annual half-marathon model in Central Germany, which attracts approximately 6,000 participants. The traditional way was to be changed in 2013 because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that the riders could cross safely. This could go either on a 60 meter 60 meter wooden bridge through a tunnel. Treiber used its model to predict the probable blockage caused in the different options. The model predicted that a mass start would risk runners if the bridge was to be used. Only by moving the starting point further from the bridge, can the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was always a risk of jam at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route. The executive organizers consulted with the team of Kreiber and finally chose this option.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the worst thing by running a marathon?", "id": "1dd246b0-1aad-4d4c-8ec6-3b9a53bdea29", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2887, "text": "dangerous blocking"}]}]}]}, {"title": "FORBES CHINA's annual celebrity list is based on i", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The annual annual forbes China is based on income and appearances in magazines, newspapers, television shows and online.The continent's stars, Taiwan and Hong Kong are included.At here are some of the winners:Jay Chou Taiwan Singer, actor and director unveiled her 12th studio album, opus 12, last December (another \"12 '\").New Flick in the works: the roof being filmed in Taiwan and LeContinental, which he watches and directs too.3.

Then he repeats the cell overflowed and extending outward to form the grid, which is a good base for a strong card structure. The bigger the grid, the more weight it can wear. Sometimes Bryan uses several cards, instead of one, to build the walls of the cell, make the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells children when he speaks in classrooms, must place your cards as close as possible when you put your grid, making sure the cards do not lean at all. After constructing this solid base, Bryan deposits cards at the top to speak for the next \"story\" of the building. It can add towers, columns, agglomerations or domes. Using the principle of cell repetition, Bryan builds incredible force structures. In non-surprising maps, Bryan has always been interested in building things. Growing up on a \"great farm farm\" in rural Iowa, it had a lot of room to play. \"We were in the middle of nowhere,\" remembers Bryan \", with a lot of space to do what we wanted. I always did something, using things like sticks or hay bullets.\" Bryan's grandfather taught him to stack cards. The two interests of Bryan - stacking buildings and cards - soon combined. But stacking on his family's farm was difficult. \"Our old house had wood floors that were not all level,\" he reports. \"And they were not very firm. When people headed, it was like\" an earthquake action \". It was a challenge to build something that would not fall immediately.\" Bryan Tower Built after the tower; He has gone through a lot of tests and error before building something bigger than himself. When he placed some cards bridges on his grid, he discovered how strong it was. The Towers of Bryan started growing up. What is the height too big? Bryan's first Guinness World Record for the world's tallest card tower came in the spring of 1992, when he was in high school. Learning that the world record was 12 feet 10 inches, Bryan built a thin ride surmounted by 14 feet 6 inches.fait as a geometry class project, it took her 40 hours and 208 cards bridges.Dow. went to win world records for even larger buildings.Son last winner measured 25 feet 3.5 inches and used about 2,400 cards bridges._ Why do not these towers fall? The key is in A good solid base, a repetitive pattern of stories and a high tape.Bryan likes to highlight how the map buildings look like real. They are constructed cellular by cell, history of history. Separate parts make a strong The heavier building, the strongest and the most stable.But the weight can not all be at the top.After having spent so much time building something so cool, Bryan admits that it's sometimes painful to see his structures destroyed.But it comp Are his work to build a sand castle or ice sculpture.", "qas": [{"question": "What was the first record of the world of Bryan?", "id": "d68e09da-c3a1-45e9-a4db-d834a13d4bc8", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2750, "text": "tallest card tower"}]}]}]}, {"title": "A study suggests that although most students at UK", "paragraphs": [{"context": "A study suggests that, although most students from British universities are satisfied with their courses, dissatisfaction has increased as fees are increasing.

In addition to the advantages of the anti-aging and healthy heart, dark chocolate can also reduce blood pressure and reduce bad cholesterol up to 10%. The lowering of blood pressure in high blood level patients is good because it will reduce the risk of stroke and certain sanitary attacks. The low levels of blood cholesterol are also good for the heart and remove the risk of blood vessels that can harden for too many cholesterol. Finally, do you know the feeling of being delighted after jogging? This feeling is like extreme happiness. Black chocolates will give you the feeling of pleasure and happiness. If you feel that the world has turned against you, a chocolate can be a mood elevator. This can help fight depression. Usually, when we feel so bad, we wanted to eat more food. If you are looking for something to eat during your bad times, try taking a mouthful of a dark chocolate and feeling well after that. These are usually the effects of healthy chocolates. This can benefit you, especially if taken in moderate amounts. About 100 grams of chocolate or less per day are already sufficiently compliant with studies. If you took too much, try to reduce your other meals for the day.
