The new mayor of the city (Kenneth Mars) assigns Captain Harris (G.W. Bailey) and Long Kinsey) (Lance Kinsey) (launches Kinsey) to the business, but then that part of it, the Wilson gang manages to slip through their fingers.The mayor wants Harris and Proctor to work with the commander of the police academy, commander Lassard (George Gaynes) on the apprehension of the gang. Lassard assembles a seven-man team consisting of Hightower (Bubba Smith), Tackleberry (David Graf), Jones (Michael Winslow), Hooks (Marion Ramsey), Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), Fackler (Bruce Mahler), and Lassard's nephew, Nick (Matt McCoy) who transfers from Miami (in the previous film Police Acdemy 5) to the city to remain close to his friends and dull-witted uncle.After distributing flyers as to the information of the Wilson gang and getting nowhere, Nick McCoy stumbles upon a paper heading of an antique diamond heading to a museum, and gets an idea to use it as bait: however the robbers nab the diamond anyway by cutting a hole in the truck and escaping through the sewer system. McCoy then decides to go undercover to get information regarding a possible hideout, but Harris decides to go undercover to get a confession.It turns out that Harris goes undercover as a window washer at a tall building, for which he has a fear of heights, and gets a confession of himself on tape after his loyal but numb-skull lacky, Proctor, accidentally knocks him over the balcony.It is revealed here that the robberies are committed by a group of three dim-witted criminals who do not seem to be able to do this on their own, and it is revealed they are being guided by a literally shadow figure known as the \"Mastermind\", who speaks to the three behind a wall of glass and uses a voice distortion device. He devises a plan to get the cops out of the way.Commandant Lassard and his men are later suspended after stolen jewellery from the last robbery is planted in Lassard's locker, pending an investigation. Misfit cops decide to clarify the name of the landard by nabbling the gang and roundness. Accessing data files from a computer, McCoy deduces that the robberies are occurring along a bus route, thus intentionally lowering property values in that part of the city. They also learn that someone must be 'leaking' information to the bad guys, which is why they are always one step ahead of the Police Academy.The Police Academy force finds and does battle with the Wilson gang, while Nick chases the leader. A pursuit follows, which leads to the Office of the Commissioner Hurst (George Robertson). It is revealed that the Mayor is the \"Mastermind\" and that Captain Harris has been unwittingly leaking information during his daily meetings with the Mayor. Hurst apologizes and reinstates the force, and a plaque is given to honor the officers' bravery the next day.As the movie closes, Harris is sitting in a chair when a string tying the balloon float is cut, lifting his chair and floating him up into the air as he shouts Proctor's name.", "qas": [{"question": "Who attributes police to investigate flights?", "id": "fdb2561b4aaf488aa8dd730911b7b059", "answers": [{"answer_start": 95, "text": "mayor of the city (Kenneth Mars"}]}, {"question": "Who is revealed to be the \"Mastermind\"?", "id": "541844a0e187448998d19db853f2f273", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2630, "text": "Mayor"}]}, {"question": "Who guides the group of three quenching criminals?", "id": "2b74193b5283473c8d6fc0318ba26ebc", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1723, "text": "Mastermind"}]}, {"question": "Who does the police academy fight?", "id": "c688c0dc1f8c4a4abe5025ff174bdd33", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2481, "text": "Wilson gang"}]}, {"question": "Did Nick have anywhere by distributing flyers?", "id": "d95559caf8454658a7bef11b3aa6466c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 865, "text": "nowhere"}]}, {"question": "In the office of who was stolen stolen jewels?", "id": "2525ab9fac564cc1b3a27b6353bdc8df", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1978, "text": "Lassard's locker"}]}, {"question": "Who involuntarily involuntarily involuntary information during his daily meetings with the mayor?", "id": "aa4c9734dbe74318804a82daa08f87b2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 136, "text": "Captain Harris"}]}, {"question": "How does Nick discover the diamond that it uses as bait?", "id": "d8e049e65b7f4edda8f887e44e4c53ba", "answers": [{"answer_start": 901, "text": "paper"}]}, {"question": "What gang does the police academy find and makes the battle?", "id": "944fce391f9b440a9b4cc44a2b792215", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2481, "text": "Wilson gang"}]}, {"question": "Who pursues the chef?", "id": "bbf25c48c1454998a32209058a228999", "answers": [{"answer_start": 874, "text": "Nick"}]}, {"question": "What does Harris shout when he floats in the air?", "id": "b2d80c4133494ee596e6e67219cc68fd", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3032, "text": "Proctor's name"}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the gang in search of the police?", "id": "54f5ea8715d0408893b1f1201b6a6498", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2481, "text": "Wilson gang"}]}, {"question": "Who has nabbed the diamond?", "id": "c60bb3a144ab4e3ca7700ac28224f8ba", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2481, "text": "Wilson gang"}]}, {"question": "Who is the Mastermind?", "id": "1c51bd10808a4504b8937920908f6703", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2630, "text": "Mayor"}]}, {"question": "What is given to honor the bravery of officers?", "id": "11136749c9b44320a080f4f50a22eb2d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2763, "text": "Hurst"}]}, {"question": "Who distributes flyers?", "id": "bf41d077ccdb4ddca1269ba500c5f31b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 874, "text": "Nick McCoy"}]}, {"question": "Where does Nick deduce the flights that flights occur?", "id": "b95af67071d84907b8bf3a9f6b5a118f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2194, "text": "along a bus route"}]}, {"question": "What are the police investigations?", "id": "61d51cc05ac448948d09821b5b914ea3", "answers": [{"answer_start": 32, "text": "series of robberies"}]}, {"question": "What are the police assigned to investigate?", "id": "b15b8b2b09004bcc915e0ce657bf316d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2170, "text": "robberies"}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the Gangs Nick tries to go down?", "id": "973e8e8403ac4946bce30fb5e5aa6000", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2481, "text": "Wilson gang"}]}, {"question": "What is given to honor the bravery of the officers the next day?", "id": "bc0097fe33a4472e91ac2c6a8acd8bb8", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2812, "text": "plaque"}]}, {"question": "What does Nick have an idea to use diamond like?", "id": "c2ba917e-c469-4d3b-af89-ebfb6e973072", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2874, "text": "plaque"}]}]}]}, {"title": "\n\nThe film begins some years in the future from th", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The film begins a few years in the future from this exact moment.
